# "Mishka" Shop

This is my project from second professional HTML, CSS course. I made this website from template using Photoshop and Zeplin.
#### The HTML markup is semantic using BEM methodology.
On this course I learned how to use preprocessors as Less and SCSS (Sass). Also I got plenty information about optimization, automatization using npm with Gulp, retina optimization and responsive images. I made this site using Mobile-first.
This is adaptive website, which has good accessibility.
